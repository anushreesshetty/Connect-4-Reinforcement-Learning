# Connect Four Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview

Connect Four Reinforcement Learning is a Python-based implementation of the classic game Connect Four, enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) gameplay. The project's primary goal is to demonstrate how a reinforcement learning agent can be trained to play Connect Four effectively.

## Project Goals

1. **Game Implementation**: This project provides a fully functional implementation of Connect Four, allowing two players to engage in the game. Additionally, it offers a mode where players can challenge an AI opponent.

2. **Reinforcement Learning**: The core objective is to showcase how reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to train an AI agent to make intelligent moves in Connect Four. The AI learns by playing the game and optimizing its strategy over time.

3. **Documentation**: We aim to provide comprehensive documentation to help users understand the game, its rules, and how to interact with the AI agent. Clear and accessible documentation is crucial for users, developers, and AI enthusiasts interested in exploring the project.

## Main Features

- **Connect Four Gameplay**: Enjoy a classic game of Connect Four with a user-friendly interface.
- **AI Opponent**: Challenge a trained reinforcement learning agent in single-player mode.
- **Random Move Mode**: For testing purposes, there's an option to play against an AI that makes random moves.
- **Reinforcement Learning Training**: Although not explicitly covered in this code snippet, the project can serve as a foundation for training reinforcement learning models on Connect Four.
